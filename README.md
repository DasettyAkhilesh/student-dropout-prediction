## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
To build a machine learning model that predicts student dropout risk using behavioral and demographic data.

---

## ðŸ“Š Features Used  
- Gender, Nationality, Class, Absence days  
- Visited Resources, Raised Hands, Discussion posts

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Model & Results  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Accuracy: ~88%  
- Top Predictors: Absence Days, Visited Resources, Raised Hands

---

## ðŸ“· Visuals  
Include screenshots of graphs or confusion matrix (optional)

---

## âœ… What I Learned  
- Data cleaning, visualization  
- Model building and evaluation  
- Feature importance analysis

---

## ðŸš€ Future Ideas  
- Deploy with Streamlit or Gradio  
- Extend to other student behavior datasets
