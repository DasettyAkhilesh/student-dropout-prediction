# ðŸŽ“ Student Dropout Prediction using Machine Learning

**Created by**: Akhil â€“ Aspiring AI/ML Engineer  
**Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Google Colab  
**Dataset Source**: [xAPI-Edu-Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
To build a machine learning model that predicts student dropout risk using behavioral and demographic data.

---

## ðŸ“Š Features Used  
- Gender, Nationality, Class, Absence days  
- Visited Resources, Raised Hands, Discussion posts
  ## ðŸ“· Feature Importance

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Model & Results  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Accuracy: ~88%  
- Top Predictors: Absence Days, Visited Resources, Raised Hands
