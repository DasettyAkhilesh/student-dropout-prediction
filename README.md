## 🎯 Objective  
To build a machine learning model that predicts student dropout risk using behavioral and demographic data.

---

## 📊 Features Used  
- Gender, Nationality, Class, Absence days  
- Visited Resources, Raised Hands, Discussion posts
  ## 📷 Feature Importance

---

## 📈 Model & Results  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Accuracy: ~88%  
- Top Predictors: Absence Days, Visited Resources, Raised Hands
